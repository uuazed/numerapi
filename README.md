# Numerai Python API
Automatically download and upload data for the Numerai machine learning
competition.

This library is a Python client to the Numerai API. The interface is programmed
in Python and allows downloading the training data, uploading predictions, and
accessing user, submission and competitions information.

If you encounter a problem or have suggestions, feel free to open an issue.

# Installation
`pip install --upgrade numerapi`

# Usage

Numerapi can be used as a regular, importable Python module or from the command
line.

Some actions (like uploading predictions or staking) require a token to verify
that it is really you interacting with Numerai's API. These tokens consists of
a `public_id` and `secret_key`. Both can be obtained by login in to Numer.ai and
going to Account -> Custom API Keys. Tokens can be passed to the Python module
as parameters or you can be set via environment variables (`NUMERAI_PUBLIC_ID`
and `NUMERAI_SECRET_KEY`).

## Python module

Usage example:

    # some API calls do not require logging in
    napi = numerapi.NumerAPI(verbosity="info")
    # download current dataset
    napi.download_current_dataset(unzip=True)
    # get competitions
    all_competitions = napi.get_competitions()
    # get leaderboard for the current round
    leaderboard = napi.get_leaderboard()
    # leaderboard for a historic round
    leaderboard_67 = napi.get_leaderboard(round_num=67)
    # check if a new round has started
    if napi.check_new_round():
        print("new round has started wihtin the last 24hours!")
    else:
        print("no new round within the last 24 hours")

    # provide api tokens
    example_public_id = "somepublicid"
    example_secret_key = "somesecretkey"
    napi = NumerAPI(example_public_id, example_secret_key)

    # upload predictions
    submission_id = napi.upload_predictions("mypredictions.csv")
    # check submission status
    napi.submission_status()

## Command line interface
